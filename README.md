adventurepage
=============

This project is an interactive storytelling app. The goal is to create a visually engaging, interactive experience for users that encourages them to dive into the stories with a simple interface.

The main function of this site is that there are a number of user-created "stories". Each story is composed of nodes, and the reader will be presented with two choices at each node, each of which will direct them to a new node written by a user based on that choice. If they get to a point where two choices have not been previously created by users, users will have the option to "choose your own adventure," which will prompt them to create a choice and the content of the next bit of the story. This will be stored remotely, and can be viewed by all users.

There is also a page that allows users to create entirely new adventures with a simple form, and those will be posted on the index page.

This is made possible by storing the ndoes as JSON objects on the firebase cloud service, each with a unique address which is found based on the choices that the user has made.
